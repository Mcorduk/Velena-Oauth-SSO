Figuring out who people are is hard on the internet. It's pretty tough to keep track of all that yourself. OAuth is basically the industry standard for web apps to vouch for each other. You're basically asking, Google, Microsoft,Linkedin to keep track of it for you in a few steps:

    Someone walks up to your website and asks to come in. You have no idea who they are and have very little idea how to check. You ask Google to check for you since they have a whole system in place to do that.

    They tell Google who they are (usually through a reroute to a login page or through a pop up and they supply their Google credentials) and then Google turns around and tells you, 'Yeah, they're who they say they are' and hand you a signed piece of paper with their seal of approval on it (Rerouted back to your application with an auth code).

    Now that Google said it was okay and gave you the thumbs up, you can now tell Google that you're cool with letting them in if they're cool with it. Google says 'okay' tells the person what information Google is going to tell you, and then gives them a temporary key (passing the auth code for a web token).

    This key is now good for whatever you set it up to be good for (at the registration of your     app) and works for those approved parts of Google as well. Google told you that person is who   they say they are and they're good at knowing these types of things.

1. Establish Folder Structure:

Create folders for models, controllers, services, middlewares, routes, tests, and config.
Organize files within each folder for clarity and maintainability. 2. Implement Core Models:

Use Mongoose to define schemas for:
User (username, email, password hash, etc.)
Client (client ID, client secret, redirect URIs, etc.)
Access Token (client ID, user ID, scopes, expiration, etc.)
Refresh Token (client ID, user ID, scopes, expiration, etc.) 3. Write Tests for Models (TDD):

Use Jest to create tests for model validation, persistence, and retrieval.
Ensure models meet requirements before implementing functionality. 4. Create Services:

Encapsulate core business logic in reusable services:
UserService (register, authenticate, find user, etc.)
ClientService (create client, find client, generate client credentials, etc.)
TokenService (generate access tokens, refresh tokens, revoke tokens, etc.) 5. Write Tests for Services (TDD):

Test service methods comprehensively, ensuring correct behavior and error handling. 6. Implement Controllers:

Define Express routes and controller functions for OAuth endpoints:
Authorization Code Grant flow
Client Credentials Grant flow
Password Grant flow (if applicable)
User registration and authentication 7. Write Tests for Controllers (TDD):

Test controller responses, data handling, and integration with services. 8. Create Middlewares:

Handle authentication, authorization, validation, and error handling:
Authentication middleware (verify access tokens)
Authorization middleware (enforce access control)
Validation middleware (check request parameters)
Error handling middleware (centralized error handling) 9. Write Tests for Middlewares (TDD):

Ensure middlewares function as intended and handle errors gracefully. 10. Configure Express Application:

Set up Express app, middlewares, and routes.
Integrate with MongoDB using Mongoose.
Configure error handling, logging, and security headers (using Helmet). 11. Enhance Security:

Implement robust password hashing (using bcrypt).
Enforce rate limiting (using express-rate-limit).
Secure sensitive data.
Validate and sanitize user input.
Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF). 12. Document API:

Use Swagger for interactive API documentation and testing. 13. Additional Considerations:

Implement session management (using express-session) if needed.
Consider caching strategies for performance optimization.
Integrate with external authentication providers (e.g., Google, LinkedIn).
Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities.
